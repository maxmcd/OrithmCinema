/************************************************************************
This program is a pos system for a theatre called Orithm Cinema, 		*
The cinema has 15 rows of seats and 30 seats in reach row.				*
The program allows the user to:											*
	Sell Tickets and Generate a daily report 							*
There is also an admin menu that allows the user to: 					*
	Adjust pricing per row, Re-initialize all pricing, Adjust Tax, 		*
	and change Admin credentials. 										*
The program has two classes seperate that are used throughout the 		*
program called PosTerm and AdminTerm. A color coded chart is provided 	*
for the user for easier viewing;  										*
This chart is stored in an array for data handling. 					*
